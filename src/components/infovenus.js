    <h1>Venus</h1>
    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and, rarely, is visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, setting in the west just after dusk and rising in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any planet in the Solar System and goes in the opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east). Venus does not have any natural satellites, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among planets in the Solar System.</p>
<p>Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition.
It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide.
    The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest
planet in the Solar System, with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of
highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid,
    preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past,but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose
due to a runaway greenhouse effect.The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because
of the lack of a planetary magnetic field.Venus's surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and is periodically resurfaced by volcanism.</p>
<p>As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the morning star and evening star. Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BC.</p>
<p>As the planet with the closest approach to Earth, Venus has been a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft
(Mariner 2 in 1962), and the first to be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light, and the first
detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions.</p>
<p>Since 1963, claims are suggesting that tiny objects that were discovered in Venus atmospheric clouds are sort of living bacteria. The first article that claimed that theory,
    which published on Nature by Carl Sagan and Harold J. Morowitz, states "While the surface conditions of Venus make the hypothesis of life there implausible, the clouds of Venus
are a different story altogether. As was pointed out some years ago, water, carbon dioxide and sunlight—the prerequisites for photosynthesis—are plentiful in the vicinity of the clouds."
More than that, recent researches suggesting that the light absorbance of those objects almost identical to the light absorbance of the organisms in the earth clouds.
    The size is very similar between those two as well.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Venusian surface was a subject of speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the 20th century. Venera landers in 1975 and 1982 returned
images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks. The surface was mapped in detail by Magellan in 1990–91. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism,
    and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there have been recent eruptions.</p>
<p>About 80% of the Venusian surface is covered by smooth, volcanic plains, consisting of 70% plains with wrinkle ridges and 10% smooth or lobate plains.
    Two highland "continents" make up the rest of its surface area, one lying in the planet's northern hemisphere and the other just south of the equator. The northern continent
is called Ishtar Terra after Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess of love, and is about the size of Australia. Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus, lies on Ishtar Terra. Its
peak is 11 km (7 mi) above the Venusian average surface elevation.The southern continent is called Aphrodite Terra, after the Greek goddess of love, and is the larger
of the two highland regions at roughly the size of South America. A network of fractures and faults covers much of this area.</p>
<p>The absence of evidence of lava flow accompanying any of the visible calderas remains an enigma. The planet has few impact craters,
    demonstrating that the surface is relatively young, approximately 300–600 million years old.3435 Venus has some unique surface features in addition
to the impact craters, mountains, and valleys commonly found on rocky planets. Among these are flat-topped volcanic features called "farra", which look
somewhat like pancakes and range in size from 20 to 50 km (12 to 31 mi) across, and from 100 to 1,000 m (330 to 3,280 ft) high; radial, star-like fracture
systems called "novae"; features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs, known as "arachnoids"; and "coronae", circular rings of fractures
sometimes surrounded by a depression. These features are volcanic in origin.</p>
<p>Most Venusian surface features are named after historical and mythological women.Exceptions are Maxwell Montes, named after James Clerk Maxwell, and highland regions
Alpha Regio, Beta Regio, and Ovda Regio. The latter three features were named before the current system was adopted by the International Astronomical Union, the body which
oversees planetary nomenclature.</p>
<h2>Surface geology</h2>

<p>Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity. Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it has 167 large volcanoes that
are over 100 km (62 mi) across. The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.This is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth,
    but because its crust is older. Earth's oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates, and has an average age of about 100 million
years,whereas the Venusian surface is estimated to be 300–600 million years old.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning
on Venus,and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning and thunder.4445 The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler
waves further confirming the occurrence of lightning on Venus.4647 One possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence
comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped by a factor of 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold.
    This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>In 2008 and 2009, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was observed by Venus Express, in the form of four transient localized infrared hot spots within the rift zone
Ganis Chasma,n 1 near the shield volcano Maat Mons. Three of the spots were observed in more than one successive orbit. These spots are thought to represent lava freshly released by volcanic eruptions.
    The actual temperatures are not known, because the size of the hot spots could not be measured, but are likely to have been in the 800–1,100 K (527–827 °C; 980–1,520 °F) range, relative to a normal temperature of 740 K (467 °C; 872 °F).</p>
<p>The plains of Venus are outlined in red and gold, with impact craters leaving golden rings across the surface
Impact craters on the surface of Venus (false-colour image reconstructed from radar data)</p>
<p>Almost a thousand impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states
of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in
pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago,
    followed by a decay in volcanism.55 Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat
from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100
million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.</p>
<p>Venusian craters range from 3 to 280 km (2 to 174 mi) in diameter. No craters are smaller than 3 km, because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects.
    Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed down so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater. Incoming projectiles less than 50 m (160 ft)
in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.</p>
<h2>Internal structure</h2>
<p>Venus is represented without its atmosphere; the mantle (red) is slightly larger than the core (yellow)
The internal structure of Venus – the crust (outer layer), the mantle (middle layer) and the core (yellow inner layer)</p>
<p>Without seismic data or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus.
    The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian
core is at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate.59 The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower
in its deep interior than Earth's.60 The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too
strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation
for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.61 Instead, Venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing events.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere and climate</h2>
<p>The atmosphere of Venus appears darker and lined with shadows. The shadows trace the prevailing wind direction.

<p>Venus has an extremely dense atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide.
    The mass of its atmosphere is 93 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface is about 92 times that at Earth's—a pressure equivalent to that at a
depth of nearly 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) under Earth's oceans. The density at the surface is 65 kg/m3, 6.5% that of water or 50 times as dense as Earth's atmosphere at
293 K (20 °C; 68 °F) at sea level. The CO2-rich atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System, creating surface temperatures of at least
735 K (462 °C; 864 °F). This makes Venus's surface hotter than Mercury's, which has a minimum surface temperature of 53 K (−220 °C; −364 °F) and
maximum surface temperature of 700 K (427 °C; 801 °F),6465 even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only 25%
of Mercury's solar irradiance. This temperature is higher than that used for sterilization.</p>
<p>Studies have suggested that billions of years ago Venus's atmosphere was much more like Earth's than it is now, and that there may have been substantial
quantities of liquid water on the surface, but after a period of 600 million to several billion years,66 a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation
of that original water, which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere. Although the surface conditions on Venus are no longer hospitable
to any Earth-like life that may have formed before this event, there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the upper cloud layers of Venus, 50 km (31 mi) up
from the surface, where the temperature ranges between 303 and 353 K (30 and 80 °C; 86 and 176 °F) but the environment is acidic.</p>
<p>Thermal inertia and the transfer of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, but because of the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even if the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen were not a problem.</p>
<p>Above the dense CO2 layer are thick clouds consisting mainly of sulfuric acid, which is formed by sulfur dioxide and water through a chemical reaction resulting in sulfuric
acid hydrate. Additionally, the atmosphere consists of approximately 1% ferric chloride.7273 Other possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate, aluminium
chloride and phosphoric anhydride. Clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size distributions. These clouds reflect and scatter about 90% of the
sunlight that falls on them back into space, and prevent visual observation of Venus's surface. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the
Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground. Strong 300 km/h (185 mph) winds at the cloud tops go around Venus about every four to five Earth days.74 Winds on Venus move
at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest winds are only 10–20% rotation speed.</p>
<p>The surface of Venus is effectively isothermal; it retains a constant temperature not only between day and night sides but between the equator and the poles.
    Venus's minute axial tilt—less than 3°, compared to 23° on Earth—also minimises seasonal temperature variation. Altitude is one of the few factors that affect Venusian
temperature. The highest point on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is therefore the coolest point on Venus, with a temperature of about 655 K (380 °C; 715 °F) and an atmospheric
pressure of about 4.5 MPa (45 bar).7879 In 1995, the Magellan spacecraft imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks that bore a strong
resemblance to terrestrial snow. This substance likely formed from a similar process to snow, albeit at a far higher temperature. Too volatile to condense on the surface, it rose
in gaseous form to higher elevations, where it is cooler and could precipitate. The identity of this substance is not known with certainty, but speculation has ranged from elemental tellurium to lead sulfide (galena).</p>
<p>Although Venus has no seasons to speak of, in 2019 astronomers identified a cyclical variation in sunlight absorption by the atmosphere, possibly caused by opaque, absorbing particles suspended in the upper clouds. The variation causes observed changes in the speed of Venus's zonal winds, and appears to rise and fall in time with the Sun's 11-year sunspot cycle.</p>
<p>The clouds of Venus may be capable of producing lightning.82 The existence of lightning in the atmosphere of Venus has been controversial since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. In 2006–07, Venus Express clearly detected whistler mode waves, the signatures of lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. According to these measurements, the lightning rate is at least half of that on Earth.46 In 2007, Venus Express discovered that a huge double atmospheric vortex exists at the south pole.</p>
<p>Venus Express also discovered, in 2011, that an ozone layer exists high in the atmosphere of Venus.85 On 29 January 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of Venus streams outwards in a manner similar to "the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions."</p>
<p>In December 2015 and to a lesser extent in April and May 2016, researchers working on Japan's Akatsuki mission observed bow shapes in the atmosphere of Venus. This was considered direct evidence of the existence of perhaps the largest stationary gravity waves in the solar system.</p>
<h2>Orbit and rotation</h2>
<p>the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are seen in motion from the top down against a spiderweb graph. Earth's orbit leaves a blue trail, while Venus's orbit leaves a yellow trail
Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 108 million kilometres (about 0.7 AU) and completes an orbit every 224.7 days. Venus is the second planet from the Sun and orbits the Sun approximately 1.6 times (yellow trail) in Earth's 365 days (blue trail)</p>
<p>Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72 AU (108 million km; 67 million mi), and completes an orbit every 224.7 days. Although all planetary orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.01.3 When Venus lies between Earth and the Sun in inferior conjunction, it makes the closest approach to Earth of any planet at an average distance of 41 million km (25 million mi).3 However, it spends a large amount of its time away from Earth, meaning that it is the closest planet to Earth for only a minority of the time. This means that Mercury is actually the planet that is closest to Earth a plurality of the time.101 The planet reaches inferior conjunction every 584 days, on average.3 Because of the decreasing eccentricity of Earth's orbit, the minimum distances will become greater over tens of thousands of years. From the year 1 to 5383, there are 526 approaches less than 40 million km; then there are none for about 60,158 years.</p>
<p>All the planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in a anticlockwise direction as viewed from above Earth's north pole. Most planets also rotate on their axes in an anti-clockwise
direction, but Venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243 Earth days—the slowest rotation of any planet. Because its rotation is so slow, Venus is very close to spherical.
    A Venusian sidereal day thus lasts longer than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). Venus's equator rotates at 6.52 km/h (4.05 mph), whereas Earth's rotates at 1,674.4 km/h
(1,040.4 mph).107108 Venus's rotation has slowed down in the 16 years between the Magellan spacecraft and Venus Express visits; each Venusian sidereal day has increased by 6.5
minutes in that time span.109 Because of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day, at 116.75 Earth days (making the
Venusian solar day shorter than Mercury's 176 Earth days).110 One Venusian year is about 1.92 Venusian solar days. To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east,111 although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.</p>
Venus may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.113114 The 584-day average interval between successive close approaches to Earth is almost exactly equal to 5 Venusian solar days,115 but the hypothesis of a spin–orbit resonance with Earth has been discounted.116
<p>Venus has no natural satellites.117 It has several trojan asteroids: the quasi-satellite 2002 VE68118119 and two other temporary trojans, 2001 CK32 and 2012 XE133.120 In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported a moon orbiting Venus, which was named Neith and numerous sightings were reported over the following 200 years, but most were determined to be stars in the vicinity. Alex Alemi's and David Stevenson's 2006 study of models of the early Solar System at the California Institute of Technology shows Venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago.121 About 10 million years later, according to the study, another impact reversed the planet's spin direction and caused the Venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with Venus.122 If later impacts created moons, these were removed in the same way. An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.</p>
