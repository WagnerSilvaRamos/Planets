    <h1>Pluto</h1>
    <p>Pluto (minor planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first Kuiper belt
object to be discovered and is the largest known plutoid (or ice dwarf).</p>
<p>Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 as the ninth planet from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery
of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. In 2005, Eris, a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered.
    This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term "planet" formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded
Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet.</p>
<p>It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume
but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—about one-sixth the mass of the
Moon and one-third its volume. It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU (4.4–7.4 billion km)
from the Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding.
    Light from the Sun takes about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5 AU).</p>
<p>Pluto has five known moons: Charon (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are
sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body.</p>
<p>The New Horizons spacecraft performed a flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015, becoming the first ever spacecraft to do so. During
    its brief flyby, New Horizons made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers
announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins, organic macromolecules that may be ingredients
for the emergence of life, and produced from methane, nitrogen and other gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred about
19,000 km (12,000 mi) to the orbiting moon.</p>

<p>In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations
in the orbit of Uranus.[13] Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by' +
' another planet besides Neptune.</p>
    <p>In 1906, Percival Lowell—a wealthy Bostonian who had founded Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894—started an extensive project
in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed "Planet X". By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for
    such a planet.[15] Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images
of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were. There are fourteen other known precovery observations, with
    the earliest made by the Yerkes Observatory on August 20, 1909.</p>
<p>Percival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and the search for
    Planet X did not resume until 1929.[18] Vesto Melvin Slipher, the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old Clyde Tombaugh,
    who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.</p>
<p>Tombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had ' +
'shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any ' +
'objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible ' +
'moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement.[19] After the ' +
'observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.[15] Pluto ' +
'has yet to complete a full orbit of the Sun since its discovery because one Plutonian year is 247.68 years long.</p>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>The discovery made headlines around the globe.[21] Lowell Observatory, which had the right to name the new object, received more than 1,000
suggestions from all over the world, ranging from Atlas to Zymal.[22] Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone
else did. Constance Lowell proposed Zeus, then Percival and finally Constance. These suggestions were disregarded.</p>
<p>The name Pluto, after the god of the underworld, was proposed by Venetia Burney (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who
was interested in classical mythology.[24] She suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather Falconer Madan, a former librarian at the University of Oxford's ' +
'Bodleian Library, who passed the name to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled it to colleagues in the United States.</p>
<p>Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three potential names: Minerva (which was already the name for an asteroid),
Cronus (which had lost reputation through being proposed by the unpopular astronomer Thomas Jefferson Jackson See), and Pluto. Pluto received every vote.
    The name was announced on May 1, 1930.[24][26] Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia £5 (equivalent to 300 GBP, or 450 USD in 2014)[ as a reward.</p>
<p>The final choice of name was helped in part by the fact that the first two letters of Pluto are the initials of Percival Lowell. Pluto's astronomical symbol ' +
'(Pluto symbol.svg, Unicode U+2647, ♇) was then created as a monogram constructed from the letters "PL".[28] Pluto's astrological symbol resembles that
    of Neptune (Neptune symbol.svg), but has a circle in place of the middle prong of the trident (Pluto's astrological symbol.svg).</p>
<p>The name was soon embraced by wider culture. In 1930, Walt Disney was apparently inspired by it when he introduced for Mickey
    Mouse a canine companion named Pluto, although Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen could not confirm why the name was given.[
    In 1941, Glenn T. Seaborg named the newly created element plutonium after Pluto, in keeping with the tradition of naming elements after
newly discovered planets, following uranium, which was named after Uranus, and neptunium, which was named after Neptune.</p>
<p>Most languages use the name "Pluto" in various transliterations.[h] In Japanese, Houei Nojiri suggested the translation Meiōsei
(冥王星, "Star of the King (God) of the Underworld"), and this was borrowed into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese (which instead uses "Sao Diêm Vương",
    which was derived from the Chinese term 閻王 (Yánwáng), as "minh" is a homophone for the Sino-Vietnamese words for "dark" (冥) and "bright" (明)).
Some Indian languages use the name Pluto, but others, such as Hindi, use the name of Yama, the God of Death in Hindu and Buddhist mythology.
    Polynesian languages also tend to use the indigenous god of the underworld, as in Māori Whiro.</p>
<h2>Planet X disproved</h2>
<p>Once Pluto was found, its faintness and lack of a resolvable disc cast doubt on the idea that it was Lowell's Planet X.+
'Estimates of Pluto's mass were revised downward throughout the 20th century.</p>
<p>Astronomers initially calculated its mass based on its presumed effect on Neptune and Uranus. In 1931, Pluto was calculated to be
roughly the mass of Earth, with further calculations in 1948 bringing the mass down to roughly that of Mars.[36][38] In 1976, Dale Cruikshank,
    Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the University of Hawaii calculated Pluto's albedo for the first time, finding that it matched that for methane ' +
'ice; this meant Pluto had to be exceptionally luminous for its size and therefore could not be more than 1 percent the mass of Earth.[39] (Pluto's albedo is
1.4–1.9 times that of Earth.)</p>
<h2>Orbit</h2>
<p>Pluto's orbital period is currently about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of the planets, which follow nearly circular ' +
'orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and
moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies closer to the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came
to perihelion on September 5, 1989,[2][i] and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.</p>
<p>In the long term, Pluto's orbit is chaotic. Computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years (both forward and backward in time),' +
' but after intervals longer than the Lyapunov time of 10–20 million years, calculations become speculative: Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the ' +
'Solar System, hard-to-predict factors that will gradually change Pluto's position in its orbit.</p>
<p>The semi-major axis of Pluto's orbit varies between about 39.3 and 39.6 au with a period of about 19,951 years, corresponding to an orbital ' +
'period varying between 246 and 249 years. The semi-major axis and period are presently getting longer.</p>
<h2>Relationship with Neptune</h2>
<p>Despite Pluto's orbit appearing to cross that of Neptune when viewed from directly above, the two objects' orbits are aligned so that they can never
collide or even approach closely.</p>
<p> The two orbits do not intersect. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, it is also the farthest above ' +
'Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 AU above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.</p>
<p>This alone is not enough to protect Pluto; perturbations from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit' +
' (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. However, Pluto is also protected by ' +
'its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts ' +
'about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion, Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. ' +
'By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead
of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17 AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus
(11 AU).[81] The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.</p>
<p>The 2:3 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable and has been preserved over millions of years.
    This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another, and so the two bodies can never pass near each other. Even if
    Pluto's orbit were not inclined, the two bodies could never collide.[81] The long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to' +
    ' phase protection. If Pluto's period is slightly shorter than 3/2 of Neptune, its orbit relative to Neptune will drift, causing it to make closer
approaches behind Neptune's orbit. The strong gravitational pull between the two causes angular momentum to be transferred to Pluto, at ' +
'Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly more slowly, according to Kepler's third law. ' +
'After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently sped up, that Pluto's orbit relative to Neptune drifts in
the opposite direction until the process is reversed. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete</p>
<h2>Rotation</h2>
<p>Pluto's rotation period, its day, is equal to 6.39 Earth days.[89] Like Uranus, Pluto rotates on its "side" in its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120°, ' +
'and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its solstices, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous ' +
'darkness.[90] The reason for this unusual orientation has been debated. Research from the University of Arizona has suggested that it may be due to ' +
'the way that a body's spin will always adjust to minimise energy. This could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near the equator
and regions lacking mass tend towards the poles. This is called polar wander.[91] According to a paper released from the University of Arizona,
    this could be caused by masses of frozen nitrogen building up in shadowed areas of the dwarf planet. These masses would cause the body to
reorient itself, leading to its unusual axial tilt of 120°. The buildup of nitrogen is due to Pluto's vast distance from the Sun. At the equator, temperatures ' +
'can drop to −240 °C (−400.0 °F; 33.1 K), causing nitrogen to freeze as water would freeze on Earth. The same effect seen on Pluto would be observed ' +
'on Earth were the Antarctic ice sheet several times larger.</p>
