    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
    Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known
as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.</p>
<p>Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes
Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.27 Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.</p>
<p>Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with
    water, mostly by oceans.The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together contain many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute
to the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active
with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.</p>
<p>Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic
and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from
the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of
expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. Over 99% of all species32 that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today
vary widely;most species have not been described.38 Over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival.
    Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world has around 200 sovereign states</p>
<h2>Formation</h2>
<p>The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5672±0.0006 billion years ago (Bya).52 By 4.54±0.04 Bya the primordial Earth had formed.
    The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse,
    which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust
(including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth taking 10–20 million years (Mys) to form.</p>
<p>A subject of research is the formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya. A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after
a Mars-sized object, named Theia, hit Earth. In this view, the mass of Theia was approximately 10 percent of Earth,it hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its
mass merged with Earth.58 Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Bya, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater
surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth. </p>
<h2>Geological history</h2>
<p>Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.59 Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water
and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.60 In this model, atmospheric "greenhouse gases" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only
70% of its current luminosity. By 3.5 Bya, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.</p>
<p>A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled to form a solid. The two models that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day
forms or, more likely, a rapid growth65 early in Earth history66 followed by a long-term steady continental area. Continents formed by plate tectonics, a process ultimately
driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, the supercontinents have assembled and broken apart. Roughly
750 million years ago (Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia 600–540 Mya,
    then finally Pangaea, which also broke apart 180 Mya.</p>
<p>The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 Mya,71 and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 Mya.
    High-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 40,000–100,000 years. The last continental glaciation ended 10,000 years ago.</p>
<h2>Origin of life and evolution</h2>
<p>During the Neoproterozoic, 750 to 580 Mya, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "Snowball Earth", and it is of particular interest because
it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity. Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Mya, there have been five mass extinctions.
    The most recent such event was 66 Mya, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as
mammals, which at the time resembled shrews. Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66 Mys, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as Orrorin tugenensis
gained the ability to stand upright. This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the
evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 Bys, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 Bys by 40%.
The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis)
in approximately 100–900 Mys.8788 The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.89 About a billion years from now,
    all surface water will have disappeared90 and the mean global temperature will reach 70 °C (158 °F).89 The Earth is expected to be habitable until the end of photosynthesis about
500 Ma from now,87 but if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere, life may continue until a runaway greenhouse effect occurs 2.3 Ga from now.88 Anthropogenic emissions are
"probably insufficient" to cause a runaway greenhouse at current solar luminosity.91 Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to
the mantle in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.</p>
<p>The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 Bys. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present
radius.8693 Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi)
from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).
A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.</p>
<h2>Shape</h2>
<p>Shown are distances between surface relief and the geocentre. The South American Andes summits are visible as elevated areas. The shaded relief has vertical exaggeration. Data from the Earth201494 global relief model.</p>
<p>The shape of Earth is nearly spherical. There is a small flattening at the poles and bulging around the equator due to Earth's rotation.97 To second order, the Earth is approximately an oblate spheroid, whose equatorial diameter is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter,98 although the variation is less than 1% of the average radius of the Earth.</p>
<p>The point on the surface farthest from Earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador (6,384.4 km (3,967.1 mi)).The average diameter of the
reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi). Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius:
The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the Mariana Trench (10,911 metres (35,797 ft) below local sea level), whereas Mount Everest (8,848 metres (29,029 ft) above local sea level)
represents a deviation of 0.14%.</p>
<p>In geodesy, the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level.</p>
<p>Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulphur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulphur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.</p>
<p>The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulphur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash and soda.</p>
<h2>Internal structure</h2>
<p>Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust,
which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi)
under the oceans to 30–50 km (19–31 mi) for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the
tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle
occur at 410 and 660 km (250 and 410 mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer
core lies above a solid inner core.109 The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year.110 The radius
of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth. </p>
<h2>Heat</h2>
<p>Earth's internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%).113 The major heat-producing
isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F),115 and the pressure could reach 360 GPa
(52 million psi).116 Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat
production was much higher. At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.</p>
<h2>Hydrosphere</h2>
<p>The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the "Blue Planet" from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the
oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000 m (6,600 ft). The deepest underwater
location is Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of 10,911.4 m (35,799 ft).</p>
<p>The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35×1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km2 (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion km3 (320 million cu mi).142 If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km (1.68 to 1.74 mi).</p>
<p>About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.</p>
<p>The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).146 Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.147 The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.148 Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir.149 Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>The atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi),151 with a scale height of about 8.5 km (5.3 mi).3 A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules.151 Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4%151 but averages about 1%.3 The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.</p>
<p>Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today.
This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3.
    The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land.153 Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing
useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.154 This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect:
    trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane,
    nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °C (0 °F),
in contrast to the current +15 °C (59 °F),155 and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.156 In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an
orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.</p>
<h2>Weather and climate</h2>
<p>Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.</p>
<p>The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.160 Ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.</p>
<p>Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.159 Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.</p>
<p>The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude from the equator.163 Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.</p>
